##  how to set up a server with ubuntu
1. ssh into your server
```
	ssh root@your_server_ip
```
2. add a new user
```
	adduser jermaine
```
3. give root privileges to your new user
```
	usermod -aG sudo jermaine
```
4. switch to the user account
```
	su - jermaine
```
5. Create an ssh directory and authorized_keys file in the user account
```
	mkdir ~/.ssh
	chmod 700 ~/.ssh
	nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
6. add the public key by using cat command to display it
```
	//Personal Computer
	cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

	ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAA...


	// Inside authorized_keys file

	ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAA...

```
7. restrict the permissions of the authorized_keys, and exit out of user account
```
	chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

	exit
```

8. open up ssh configuration
```
	sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
9. make sure all these options have these values, then reload
```
	PasswordAuthentication no
	PubkeyAuthentication yes
	ChallengeResponseAuthentication no

	sudo systemctl reload sshd
```
